# Variable Information
# Data sets related to the 50 states of the United 
# States of America. 
# state.abb - 2-letter abbreviation of state name
# state.area - numeric vector of state area (sq. miles)
# state.center - list with components named x and y 
# giving the approximate geographic center of each state 
# in negative longitude and latitude.
# state.division - factor giving state division (New 
# England, Middle Atlantic, South Atlantic, East South 
# Central, West South Central, East North Central, West 
# North Central, Mountain, and Pacific).
# state.name - character vector of full state name
# state.region - factor of region for each state (Northeast,
# South, North Central, West). 
# state.x77 - matrix with 50 rows and 8 columns giving the 
# following statistics in the respective columns. Population: 
# population estimate. Income: per capita income. Illiteracy:
# illiteracy (percent of population). Life Exp: life expectancy 
# in years. Murder: murder and non-negligent manslaughter rate 
# per 100,000 population. HS Grad: percent high-school graduates.
# Frost: mean number of days with minimum temperature below 
# freezing (1931â€“1960) in capital or large city.  Area: land 
# area in square miles.

# Focus on the data Population, Income, Illiteracy, Life Exp,

# or state name) in mind, but do not use them in the modeling.
